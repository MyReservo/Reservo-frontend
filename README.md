This project is intended both for people looking for a specific service (customers) and for people who run a business and want to acquire customers. This web application allows customers to book an appointment at a specific time and place. On the other hand, people providing services will have access to a calendar in their panel, which will display the days on which they have an appointment with the client to perform their service.

Application under construction...
live: https://rezervo.github.io/Reservo-frontend/

 How it's working?
 
 - The first window is the registration form.  You can register as a customer and as a company.
 - After pressing the "register" button, the validation of the form will be started.
 - You will be transferred to the appropriate panel after the form has been correctly completed, currently, 
 - In order to test the application after registering as a company, You can register as a customer and then select the service (so far there are 3 to choose from), which You chose when registering the company, then after selecting the appropriate city and selecting the option to display the address of the local, the address of the company should appear that was entered during registration and the name of the service provider.
 
 In the future, a script will be added, thanks to which, after the customer selects the appropriate day in the calendar and the appropriate time, data will be sent to the calendar in the service provider's panel.
